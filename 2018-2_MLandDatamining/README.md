Machine-Learning and Data-Mining (2018 Fall)
=============  
* **Homework 1**
    * Implemented KNN, Decision Tree(DT), Support Vector Machine(SVM) with scikit-learn package
    * Performed 5-fold cross validation with scikit-learn package
    * Calculated Accuracy, Precision, Recall, f1-score, confusion matrix of each ML algorithm.
  
* **Homework 2** 
    * Implemented forward & backward function of Linear (fully-connected) layer with naive numpy package
    * Implemented forward & backward function of ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh with naive numpy package
    * Implemented forward & backward function of Conv2D, MaxPool2D with naive numpy package
    * Implemented Simple Networks(TwoLayerNet, FCNet, ThreeLayerConvNet) exploiting functions above.
    * Two Jupyter-notebook contains my implementation in this homework with training/validation loss & Accuracy graph
    
* **Team Project**  
    * Predicted future cabbage prices with various regression models.
    * We exploited a varity of regression models on the relatioship between weather information and past cabbage prices.
