m Think like a man of action and act like man of thought.
m A life without love, without the presence of the beloved, is nothing but a mere magic-lantern show. We draw out slide, swiftly tiring of each, and pushing it back to make haste for the next. Where there's smoke, there's fire.
m The will of a man is his happiness.
